# Serverless Grafana with Identity Aware Proxy

## Setup a service account to use with Terraform
1. Create a new Service Account
    - Go to IAM -> Service Accounts -> Create new Service Account
    - Grant access to roles
        - Storage Admin
        - Artifact Registry Administrator
        - Cloud SQL Admin
        - Service Management Administrator
2. Go to your newly created service account and click on “KEYS”. Create a new key and download it.

## Authenticate with your service account
3. Authenticate with your service account by running `gcloud auth activate-service-account [USERNAME]@[PROJECT-ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com --key-file=[PATH-TO-YOUR-KEYFILE]`
4. Run `gcloud auth configure-docker [GCP_REGION].pkg.dev`

## Setup Terraform
5. Run `terraform init`
6. Set required terraform variables, e.g. Linux:

    `export TF_VAR_project_id=[YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID]` You can find the project ID in the GCP console

    `export TF_VAR_support_email=[YOUR_SUPPORT_EMAIL]`
    
    `export TF_VAR_domain=[YOUR_DOMAIN]` This is the domain to host your Grafana dashboard

## Execute the Terraform script to create your Grafana Dashboard
7. Run `terraform plan` and confirm all steps are correct
8. Run `terraform apply`
9. Confirm the command has been executed successfully
10. Copy the external_ip from the console Outputs. Add an A record redirect from your domain to this IP address.
11. Wait around 5-10 minutes for GCP Load Balancer to perform certificate checks

## Access your Grafana Dashboard
1. Open an Incognito browser window. Go to admin.google.com and sign in with your GCP account owner. Create a new User (only users who are part of your domain can access the dashboard)
2. Open the GCP Console and go to IAM -> Add -> enter your user’s email (e.g. user@your-domain.com) and select role *IAP-secured Web App User*
3. Open an incognito window, go to your-domain.com (the domain you used in step 6) and sign in using the newly created user (you will be prompted to change your password the first time you login)
